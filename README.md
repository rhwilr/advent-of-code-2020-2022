# Advent of Code

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

My primary approach to the puzzles is by using TDD. I'm using 
[Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com) as a base and leverage several of Laravels components. 

## Installation

```shell
composer install
```

## Running tests

```shell
php unit
```
